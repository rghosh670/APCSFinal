Roommate Finder README
Vikram Shirsat, Rohit Ghosh, and Kishore Srinivas

Introduction: 
Instead of a usual roommate finding app or even just a questionnaire, this application has been built to minimize the possible interference of wanting to look like a good person to allow someone to find a roommate who truly is like them. In this application, a user is thrown into a first person game in which their inherent decisions that are made expose some of their inner qualities as a person. This app will force users to make decisions that relate to possible roommate qualities such as if a person is a late night or early morning person or even if they are super clean.
